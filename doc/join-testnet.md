## Starting a New Node
To start a new node, the mainnet instructions apply:

- [Join the mainnet](./join-mainnet.md)
- [Deploy a validator](./validator-setup.md)

The only difference is the SDK version and genesis file. See the [testnet repo](https://github.com/stafihub/network/tree/main/testnets) for information on testnets, including the correct version of the Cosmos-SDK to use and details about the genesis file.
