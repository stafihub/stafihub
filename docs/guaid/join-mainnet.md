# Join the StaFiHub Mainnet

## Quickstart

This Quickstart tutorial completes the following actions:

* Ensure that you have [compilation prerequisites](./install.md)
* Compile stafihub
* Give your node a moniker and configure it
* Download compressed genesis state
* Put the `genesis.json` file in the correct location

```bash
git clone -b vx.x.x https://github.com/stafihub/stafihub
cd stafihub
make install
stafihubd init chooseanicehandle
wget https://github.com/stafihub/network/blob/main/mainnets/stafihub-1/genesis.json
mv genesis.json ~/.stafihub/config/genesis.json
```

**Go**
Starts stafihub

```bash
stafihubd start  --p2p.seeds bf8328b66dceb4987e5cd94430af66045e59899f@xxx:26656,cfd785a4224c7940e9a10f6c1ab24c343e923bec@xxxx:26656,d72b3011ed46d783e369fdf8ae2055b99a1e5074@xxxx:26656
```

To save those seeds to your settings, put the comma-separated list format seeds in `~/.stafihub/config/config.toml` in the p2p section under seeds.

## Manual Setup of a new Node

These instructions are for setting up a brand new full node from scratch.

Make sure to have the [latest stafihub version installed](./join-mainnet.md).
First, initialize the node.

```bash
stafihubd init <your_custom_moniker>
```

**Note**
Monikers can contain only ASCII characters. Using Unicode characters is not supported and renders your node unreachable.

By default, the `init` command creates your `~/.stafihub` directory with subfolders `config` and `data`.
In the `config` directory, the most important files for configuration are `app.toml` and `config.toml`.

You can edit the `moniker` in the `~/.stafihub/config/config.toml` file:

```toml
# A custom human readable name for this node
moniker = "<your_custom_moniker>"
```

For optimized node performance, edit the `~/.stafihub/config/app.toml` file to enable the anti-spam mechanism and reject incoming transactions with less than the minimum gas prices:

```
# This is a TOML config file.
# For more information, see https://github.com/toml-lang/toml

##### main base config options #####

# The minimum gas prices a validator is willing to accept for processing a
# transaction. A transaction's fees must meet the minimum of any denomination
# specified in this config (for example, 10ufis).

minimum-gas-prices = "0.01ufis"
```

Your full node has been initialized!

## Genesis & Seeds

### Copy the Genesis File

Fetch the mainnet's `genesis.json` file into `stafihubd`'s config directory.

```bash
mkdir -p $HOME/.stafihub/config
wget https://github.com/stafihub/network/blob/main/mainnets/stafihub-1/genesis.json
mv genesis.json $HOME/.stafihub/config
```

If you want to connect to the public testnet instead, click [here](./join-testnet.md)

To verify the correctness of the configuration run:

```bash
stafihubd start
```

### Add Seed Nodes

Your node needs to know how to find peers. You'll need to add healthy seed nodes to `$HOME/.stafihub/config/config.toml`. The [`mainnets`](https://github.com/stafihub/network/tree/main/mainnets) repo contains links to some seed nodes.

If those seeds aren't working, you can find more seeds and persistent peers on a StaFiHub explorer (a list can be found on the [mainnets](https://github.com/stafihub/network/tree/main/mainnets)).

## A Note on Gas and Fees

On StaFiHub mainnet, the accepted denom is `ufis`, where `1fis = 1.000.000ufis`

Transactions on the StaFiHub network need to include a transaction fee in order to be processed. This fee pays for the gas required to run the transaction. The formula is the following:

```
fees = ceil(gas * gasPrices)
```

The `gas` is dependent on the transaction. Different transaction require different amount of `gas`. The `gas` amount for a transaction is calculated as it is being processed, but there is a way to estimate it beforehand by using the `auto` value for the `gas` flag. Of course, this only gives an estimate. You can adjust this estimate with the flag `--gas-adjustment` (default `1.0`) if you want to be sure you provide enough `gas` for the transaction.

The `gasPrice` is the price of each unit of `gas`. Each validator sets a `min-gas-price` value, and will only include transactions that have a `gasPrice` greater than their `min-gas-price`.

The transaction `fees` are the product of `gas` and `gasPrice`. As a user, you have to input 2 out of 3. The higher the `gasPrice`/`fees`, the higher the chance that your transaction will get included in a block.

For mainnet, the recommended `gas-prices` is `0.0025ufis`.

## Set `minimum-gas-prices`

Your full-node keeps unconfirmed transactions in its mempool. In order to protect it from spam, it is better to set a `minimum-gas-prices` that the transaction must meet in order to be accepted in your node's mempool. This parameter can be set in the following file `~/.stafihub/config/app.toml`.

The initial recommended `min-gas-prices` is `0.0025ufis`, but you might want to change it later.

## Pruning of State

There are four strategies for pruning state. These strategies apply only to state and do not apply to block storage.
To set pruning, adjust the `pruning` parameter in the `~/.stafihub/config/app.toml` file.
The following pruning state settings are available:

1. `everything`: Prune all saved states other than the current state.
2. `nothing`: Save all states and delete nothing.
3. `default`: Save the last 100 states and the state of every 10,000th block.
4. `custom`: Specify pruning settings with the `pruning-keep-recent`, `pruning-keep-every`, and `pruning-interval` parameters.

By default, every node is in `default` mode which is the recommended setting for most environments.
If you would like to change your nodes pruning strategy then you must do so when the node is initialized. Passing a flag when starting `stafihub` will always override settings in the `app.toml` file, if you would like to change your node to the `everything` mode then you can pass the `---pruning everything` flag when you call `stafihubd start`.

> Note: When you are pruning state you will not be able to query the heights that are not in your store.

## Run a Full Node

Start the full node with this command:

```bash
stafihubd start
```

Check that everything is running smoothly:

```bash
stafihubd status
```

View the status of the network with the [StaFiHub Explorer](https://stafihub.io).

## Enable the REST API

By default, the REST API is disabled. To enable the REST API, edit the `~/.stafihub/config/app.toml` file, and set `enable` to `true` in the `[api]` section.

```toml
###############################################################################
###                           API Configuration                             ###
###############################################################################
[api]
# Enable defines if the API server should be enabled.
enable = true
# Swagger defines if swagger documentation should automatically be registered.
swagger = false
# Address defines the API server to listen on.
address = "tcp://0.0.0.0:1317"
```

Optionally, you can activate swagger by setting `swagger` to `true` or change the port of the REST API in the parameter `address`.
After restarting your application, you can access the REST API on `YOURNODEIP:1317`.

## GRPC Configuration

By default, gRPC is enabled on port `9090`. In the `~/.stafihub/config/app.toml` file, you can make changes in the gRPC section. To disable the gRPC endpoint, set `enable` to `false`. To change the port, use the `address` parameter.

```toml
###############################################################################
###                           gRPC Configuration                            ###
###############################################################################
[grpc]
# Enable defines if the gRPC server should be enabled.
enable = true
# Address defines the gRPC server address to bind to.
address = "0.0.0.0:9090"
```

## Upgrades

To be best prepared for eventual upgrades, it is recommended to setup [Cosmovisor](https://docs.cosmos.network/master/run-node/cosmovisor.html), a small process manager,  which can swap in new `stafihubd` binaries.

## Background Process

To run the node in a background process with automatic restarts, you can use a service manager like `systemd`. To set this up run the following:

```bash
sudo tee /etc/systemd/system/stafihubd.service > /dev/null <<EOF  
[Unit]
Description=stafihub Daemon
After=network-online.target

[Service]
User=$USER
ExecStart=$(which stafihubd) start
Restart=always
RestartSec=3
LimitNOFILE=4096

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
EOF
```

If you're using Cosmovisor you want to add

```bash
Environment="DAEMON_HOME=$HOME/.stafihub"
Environment="DAEMON_NAME=stafihubd"
Environment="DAEMON_ALLOW_DOWNLOAD_BINARIES=false"
Environment="DAEMON_RESTART_AFTER_UPGRADE=true"
```

after the `LimitNOFILE` line and replace `$(which stafihubd)` with `$(which cosmovisor)`.

Then setup the daemon

```bash
sudo -S systemctl daemon-reload
sudo -S systemctl enable stafihubd
```

We can then start the process and confirm that it is running

```bash
sudo -S systemctl start stafihubd

sudo service stafihubd status
```

## Export State

stafihub can dump the entire application state into a JSON file. This application state dump is useful for manual analysis and can also be used as the genesis file of a new network.

Export state with:

```bash
stafihubd export > [filename].json
```

You can also export state from a particular height (at the end of processing the block of that height):

```bash
stafihubd export --height [height] > [filename].json
```

If you plan to start a new network from the exported state, export with the `--for-zero-height` flag:

```bash
stafihubd export --height [height] --for-zero-height > [filename].json
```
